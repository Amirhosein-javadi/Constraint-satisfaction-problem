        "As students are preparing for midterm exams and the virtual exam days are gone and forgotten, each department is struggling to select at least one hall out of $N$ halls in the university to hold their exams. But here's the thing:\n",
        "  - Students from each department aren't really fond of sitting next to students from other departments and must be separated (for example CE students and CS students must not share the same hall for exams).\n",
        "  - Each department likes certain halls and won't hold their exams in other halls.\n",
        "  - Sadly, the exit doors in some of the halls are stuck and the hard working staff have provided some routes so that the students from specific halls need to walk through the other hall and exit after the examination. And because they would like to prevent cheating as much as possible, students in such halls cannot be from the same department.\n",
